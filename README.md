## Inspiration for the Project:

Building a tool to address challenges such as managing finances, tracking expenses, or setting and achieving savings goals can be both practical and personally rewarding.

There's a growing demand for digital tools that help individuals manage their finances more effectively. With the increasing adoption of online banking and digital transactions, there's a need for comprehensive solutions that offer budgeting, expense tracking, and goal setting functionalities. 

Many people lack basic financial literacy skills, such as budgeting and saving. Building an application that simplifies these concepts and helps users develop better financial habits can contribute to financial empowerment and education.
